# 1. The Data Source
Talk about the source of data. Additionally, give a brief overview of some of the columns/features in your dataset.

# 2. Aim of the Project
What is the objective of the project.

# 3. Preparation of Dataset
This is where you talk about data cleaning, data wrangling, handling outliers, multicollinearity, duplicate removal, feature engineering, feature normalization, etc and also the techniques to handle each of them.

# 4. The Performance Metrics
Which metric are you trying to optimize and why using this.

# 5. Base Model
What is the base model. This will give a base for further improvement.

# 6. The Training Process
Begin with the basic spot-checking several algorithms using cross-validations, followed by selecting the one with the highest value of performance metric. Choose a final algorithm.

# 7. Fine Tuning Process
How the best model and model before them were tuned for the best parameter.

# 8. Model Deployment, if any

# 9. Question Section
Here, answer a few of the most asked questions about the project. Some questions are:

1. If you were to do something differently, what would that be?
2. If I were to change condition X in this project, how would your approach change?
3. What were the most challenging aspect of the project and how you overtook it?
4. Some mistakes you made.
5. What improvements can be made?
6. Why did this algorithm work or didn't work?
7. What were the most important features?
8. (Classification) Balanced or unbalanced classes?
