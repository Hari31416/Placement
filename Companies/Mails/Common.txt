Software development requires a particular set of skills and tools. Skills may include problem solving, logical thinking, teamwork, time management, communication and creativity. We, as students of M.Sc. Physics, already possess these skills because of our academic background.

As for tools, we have been working with both data structure and algorithms with which we can give efficient and elegant solution to complex problems. The fact that we have studied variuos courses in mathematics and physics gives us advantage with above. We have worked with more than one programming languages and are familiar with various progamming paradigms like object-oriented progamming and functional progamming. We have been exposed to cloud computing and have utilized it in some of our projects. We have done a number of projects, both academic and personal, which includes a wide range of software development domains including but not limited to web development (both front end and back end), scientific software and utilities software.

With these skills and tools under out belt and the experience and knowledge gained with our projects, we are going to be a significant asset in the team. We are thus requesting you to consider opening this position to M.Sc. Physics and give us a chance to contribute to your team as well as to be able to learn new skills and tools.
