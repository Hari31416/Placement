## Consumer Discretionary

Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.

Companies that supply these types of goods and services are usually either called consumer discretionaries or consumer cyclicals. Consumers tend to spend more on consumer discretionary products in economic growth phases, which are usually characterized by higher disposable income.
Consumer discretionary can be contrasted with consumer staples, which is a classification for companies considered to produce daily necessities.

## Consumer Staples

The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable—or unwilling—to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.

Consumer staples are considered to be non-cyclical, meaning that they are always in demand, year-round, no matter how well the economy is—or is not—performing. As such, consumer staples are impervious to business cycles. Also, people tend to demand consumer staples at a relatively constant level, regardless of their price.

Consumer staples are broken down into six industries:

- Beverages
- Food and staples retailing
- Food products
- Household products
- Personal products
- Tobacco

## Financials

The financial sector is a section of the economy made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms. The institutions can be broken down into major categories, as follows:

- Banks
- **Money market funds:** A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in high-quality, short-term debt instruments, cash, and cash equivalents.
- Insurance companies and Pension funds

## Health Care

The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. Healthcare has become one of India’s largest sectors, both in terms of revenue and employment.

## Industrial Goods

Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.

The industrial goods sector normally declines during economic recessions and rises during expansions, though its various subsectors can perform differently from one another.

## Information Technology

The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.

Tech companies invest heavily in research and development and may undertake riskier projects with greater future potential.
Tech companies run social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Companies rely on the technology sector to help them grow and thrive.
The technology sector is often one of the most attractive growth investments in an economy.

## Utilities

Utilities include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas or specialize in just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean and renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels to produce electricity.

Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service infrastructure and are heavily regulated.

## Some More Terms

**FMCG:** Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. FMCGs are often purchased frequently, require low shopping effort, and have a low unit price. Examples of FMCGs include soft drinks, toiletries, and over-the-counter drugs.

**PSU:** A public sector undertaking (PSU) is a government-owned corporation that provides a public service. The term PSU is used in India, where the government owns a large number of companies that provide essential services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications.
