# Directory Map

- `data_analyst`: For CVs where DL is not required. A small ML is required, and the candidate should be able to understand the data and make some analysis. If DLS is added in the certificates, it does not belong in this folder!
- `finance`: CVs related to finance.
- `ML_DL`: A lot of ML and DL is required.
