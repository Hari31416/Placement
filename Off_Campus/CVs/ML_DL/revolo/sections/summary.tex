\section{Data Scientist}
\small{
    As a recent graduate with a strong foundation in machine learning and data science, I have worked on several personal projects with real datasets using SQL and Python. In my projects, I have showcased my skills in \textbf{data cleaning}, \textbf{data visualizations}, and \textbf{modeling}. I've experience implementing deep learning architectures from reasearch papers and have a strong understanding of the underlying mathematics.
