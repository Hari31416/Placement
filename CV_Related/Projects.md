# Projects
## Course Projects
1. **Drop on Thin Film**
   - Used 
## ML
1. **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
   - Using the Titanic dataset, trained a model to **predict** whether a passenger survived the Titanic dis
   - aster.
   - Did **data visualization**, **feature engineering**, **data imputation** and trained **dozens** of models. Used **grid search** for each to find the best parameters.
   - Secured a place in the top **15%** on kaggle leaderboard.
   
2. **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**
   - Used about **80** different features to predict the price of a house.
   - Did **data visualization**, **feature engineering**, **data imputation** and trained **dozens** of models. Used **grid search** for each to find the best parameters.
   - Secured a place in the top **15%** on kaggle leaderboard. 
3. **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets**
   - Built **NLP** models that predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
   - Used **text vectorization** and different **word embeddings** to transform the Tweets into a **vector**.
   - Built and trained **LSTM**, **GRU** and their **bidirectional** variants as well as 1D **CNNs**.
   - Generated both **character level** and **word level** **embeddings** with the pretrained **Universal Sentence Encoder** and used them as input to create a **Multivariate** model with the **functional API** of **TensorFlow**. 
4. **DataCamp Projects**
   - Did about **9** real world projects.
5. **Final Capstone Project: Summer Analytics 2022**
   - Created **regression** models to predict the discounted price of products featured on **Amazon** and **Flipkart**.
   - Placed in top **20** on the **kaggle leaderboard**.
6. **MLS**
   - Implemented a linear **classification** as well as **regression** model **from scratch** using numpy and python.
   - Implemented **Gradient Descent**.
  
## DL
1. **Digit Recognizer**
   - Trained a very deep **convolutional neural network** with **dropout** and **batch normalization**.
   - Got an **accuracy of 99.48%** of the **test set** securing a place in the top **15%** on kaggle leaderboard. 
2. **Food Vision**
   - Trained deep **neural network** to *recognize* **101 categories of food**.
   - Used pretrained **EfficientNet** model to extract the **features**. Then **Fine tuned** it resulting in an accuracy of **80%** on the **test set**.
   - **Deployed** the model on web using **django** and **heroku**.
3. **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets**
   - Built **NLP** models that predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
   - Used **text vectorization** and different **word embeddings** to transform the Tweets into a **vector**.
   - Built **LSTM**, **GRU** and their **bidirectional** variants as well as 1D **CNNs**.
   - Finally, used the pretrained the **Universal Sentence Encoder** to make an embedding on both **character level** and **word level**.
   -  Created a **Multivariate** model using the **functional API** of **TensorFlow**.
4. **TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge**
   - Trained a **neural network** to recognize **30** different commands.
   - Created **waveforms** and then 2D **spectrograms** using **STFT** to train the **neural network**.
   - Used a deep **CNN** and got an **accuracy of about 90%** on the **test set**.
5. **Deep Learning Specialization**
   - Implemnted a **nueral network** **from scratch** using numpy and python with arbitrary **number of layers** and **number of neurons**.
   - Used **forward propagation** and **backpropagation** to train the **neural network**.

## Visualization
1. **Tableau**
   - Created a **tableau** viz with multiple **dashboards** and **stories** featuring my streaming history of Spotify for year 2021.
   - Created a viz with data **crawled** from Goodreads to show info about the books I'd read in 2020 and 2021.
2. **Titanic**
3. **Songs**

# Web Development
1. **Python Web Apps**
   - Created some **web apps** using **django**, **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap**.
   - **Deployed** the website on **Heroku**.
   - The website contains apps like **Language Detector**, **PDF Tools** and **Youtube Song Downloader**.
2. **Book Gallery**
   - Created a **responsive** website using **nodejs**, **express**, **ejs**, **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap** to feature a *gallery* of books.
   - Used **Python** to **scrap data** from Amazon and Goodreads.
   - Used **restful** routes and implemented **query parameters** to filter the data on based of the **genre**, **author** and **series**.
   - Used **MonogoDB** as database, **heroku** as deployment platform and **Amazon S3** as storage.
3. **Portfolio**
   - My portfolio website featuring almost all the projects I've done.
   - Used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** to create the website and used **Github Pages** to deploy the website.
4. **Old Website**
   - An old website I created a way back. I used **HTML**, **CSS** and vanilla **JavaScript** to create the website.
