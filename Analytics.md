# Roles in Analytics
___
Here are some job titles in the Analytics department:

## Data Analyst
A data analyst’s job functions are exactly what the job title implies — analyzing company and industry data to extract value.

Data analysts work in every industry, although job titles can vary. Some roles will have industry-specific names like “healthcare data analyst.” “Business analyst,” “intelligence analyst,” and other similarly named roles often overlap with data analyst roles.

Unlike data scientists, data analysts typically don’t need to be proficient in machine learning. Most data analyst jobs require programming and SQL skills, as well as statistical knowledge, comfort with the data analysis workflow, and data visualization skills.

Data analysts are responsible for different tasks such as visualizing, transforming, and manipulating the data. Sometimes they are also responsible for web analytics tracking and A/B testing analysis.

Since data analysts are in charge of visualization, they are often in charge of preparing the data for communication with the project's business side by preparing reports that effectively show the trends and insights gathered from their analysis.

## Data Scientist
Being a data scientist entails, you will deal with all aspects of the project. Starting from the business side to data collecting and analyzing, and finally visualizing and presting.

A data scientist knows a bit of everything; every step of the project, because of that, they can offer better insights on the best solutions for a specific project and uncover patterns and trends. Moreover, they will be in charge of researching and developing new algorithms and approaches.

Often, in big companies, team leaders in charge of people with specialized skills are data scientists; their skill set allows them to overlook a project and guide them from start to finish.

> Data scientists are often a technical step above data analysts. They can understand data from a more-informed perspective to help make predictions. 

## Data Engineer
Data engineers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines. They need to test ecosystems for the businesses and prepare them for data scientists to run their algorithms.

Data engineers also work on batch processing of collected data and match its format to the stored data. In short, they make sure that the data is ready to be processed and analyzed.

Finally, they need to keep the ecosystem and the pipeline optimized and efficient and ensure that the data is available for data scientists and analysts to use.

Data engineers often focus on larger datasets — it’s their job to optimize the infrastructure surrounding different data analytics processes.

For example, a data engineer might focus on the process of capturing data to improve acquisition pipeline efficiency. They may also need to upgrade a database infrastructure for faster queries.

## Machine Learning Scientist
A machine learning scientist researches new data manipulating approaches and design new algorithms to be used. They are often a part of the R&D department, and their work usually leads to research papers. Their work is closer to academia yet in an industry setting.

## Machine Learning Engineer
Machine learning engineers are very on-demand today. They need to be very familiar with the various machine learning algorithms like clustering, categorization, and classification and are up-to-date with the latest research advances in the field.

To perform their job properly, machine learning engineers need to have strong statistics and programming skills in addition to some knowledge of the fundamentals of software engineering.

In addition to designing and building machine learning systems, machine learning engineers need to run tests — such as A/B tests — and monitor the different systems' performance and functionality.

## Deep Learning Engineer
Deep learning research engineers are a kind of computer scientist. They specialize in using deep learning platforms for specific types of programming tasks related to artificial intelligence. Their goal is to develop programming systems that mimic brain functions. To do this, they use neural networks.

Deep learning research engineers may be involved in developing system and program design plans and determining how to integrate machines and programs. They are responsible for developing systems that can transfer data effectively and writing complex computer programming code to direct parts of the neural network to operate properly. They are required to continue researching in their field to ensure that their technological knowledge is up to date, and they may also publish works about their research. They may specifically work on things like self-driving vehicles, facial recognition software and robots.
