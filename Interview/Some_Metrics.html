    <h1 id="metrics">Metrics</h1>
    <h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
    <h3 id="cross-selling">Cross Selling</h3>
    <p>Cross-selling is encouraging the purchase of anything in conjunction with the primary product. For example, if a
        customer has already purchased a subscription to your marketing tool, cross-selling would encourage that
        customer to purchase a subscription to your CRM.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Say you work at a fast-food franchise, and a patron orders a burger. If you wanted to cross-sell, you would
            offer extra items to make for a complete meal.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="up-selling">Up Selling</h3>
    <p>Up-selling is encouraging the purchase of a more expensive product. For example, if a customer has already
        purchased a subscription to your marketing tool, up-selling would encourage that customer to purchase a
        subscription to your marketing tool with additional features.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To upsell a burger, you’d offer options for a more elaborate burger. So, for example, adding a slice of
            cheese or a pickle for an additional fee. Or, you could tell them about a higher-quality cut of beef they
            could choose for a small premium.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="metrics-for-business-performance">Metrics For Business Performance</h2>
    <h3 id="total-revenue">Total Revenue</h3>
    <p>Arguably the most important metric of any business is revenue. Total revenue can be measured on any time scale,
        typically monthly, quarterly, or annually.</p>
    <h3 id="average-revenue-per-accountproductcustomer">Average Revenue Per Account/Product/Customer</h3>
    <p>The average revenue brought in by a single product, service, account, or customer helps leaders and managers to
        understand where they should focus their attention and resources.</p>
    <h3 id="market-penetration">Market Penetration</h3>
    <p>Understanding your market share is important because it measures where your business is compared to the expected
        growth outlined in your business or sales plan. Usually, you will find businesses measuring this against their
        total addressable market (TAM), which is an estimation of how big a given market is for a product or service.
    </p>
    <h3 id="percentage-of-revenue-from-new-vs-existing-customers">Percentage of Revenue from New vs. Existing Customers
    </h3>
    <p>Understanding what percentage of revenue is from new and existing customers is helpful for a few reasons. For
        example, if existing customers account for a growing percentage of total revenue, this can be an indicator your
        RevOps team is doing a great job of upselling and growing accounts, but the team tasked with acquiring new logos
        is lagging behind.</p>
    <p>If new customers are the lion’s share of your revenue, then this could either be an indicator of a high churn
        rate or hypergrowth. To understand at what end of the spectrum your team is trending, it’s important to track
        LTV, NPS, and more.</p>
    <h3 id="win-rate">Win Rate</h3>
    <p>Win rate, or the opportunity-to-win ratio, is the measurement of successful deals or deals that close, in
        comparison to the total deals made – including those that are open, lost, slipped, or in another pipeline phase.
    </p>
    <h3 id="year-over-year-growth">Year-Over-Year Growth</h3>
    <p>Although growth can be measured over any timeframe – such as month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, or
        year-over-year – annual growth showcases high-level execution of strategy and whether long-term growth goals
        have been achieved.</p>

    <h3 id="lifetime-value-ltv-of-a-customer">Lifetime Value (LTV) of a Customer</h3>
    <p>Lifetime value is the revenue that can be expected throughout the duration of the average relationship with a
        customer.</p>
    <h3 id="net-promoter-score-nps">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h3>
    <p>What is the likelihood that your customers will recommend your product or service to their network?</p>
    <p>This question is what sales professionals have in mind when they measure net promoter score, where they ask each
        customer the likelihood of them promoting their business through word of mouth from 1 (not very likely) to 10
        (very likely).</p>
    <h3 id="sales-expense-ratio">Sales Expense Ratio</h3>
    <p>It’s important to understand how your sales costs, direct customer acquisition costs, and indirect operating
        expenses compare to your revenue. The higher your sales expense ratio, the less profitable your sales
        organization will be.</p>
    <h2 id="website-performance-metrics">Website Performance Metrics</h2>
    <h3 id="conversion-rate">Conversion Rate</h3>
    <p>Conversion rate is the percentage of visitors to your website who take a desired action. For example, if you have
        a landing page with a form to download a whitepaper, the conversion rate would be the percentage of visitors who
        fill out the form.</p>
    <h3 id="bounce-rate">Bounce Rate</h3>
    <p>The bounce rate can be defined as the percentage of web users who leave your website after only viewing a single
        page.</p>
    <p>A high bounce rate is indicative of your landing page not being what visitors expected, usually in the form of
        content. Since they had no interest in the material they saw and taking action, they left the page without
        clicking on a link, completing a form, etc.</p>
    <h3 id="page-views">Page Views</h3>
    <p>This is probably the most obvious metric that helps to determine the success of your landing page since it
        measures the number of people who are looking at your landing page.</p>
    <p>Page Views metric allows you to see which pages are getting the most and least traffic.</p>
    <h3 id="average-time-spent-on-page">Average Time Spent on Page</h3>
    <p>Keeping an eye on how long visitors are staying on your landing page can be useful. However, keep in mind that
        the kind of landing page you have can have a direct impact on this metric.</p>
    <p>Therefore, a shorter or longer average time spent on the page doesn’t have to indicate that your landing page is
        not performing well.</p>
    <h3 id="sessions-by-source">Sessions by Source</h3>
    <p>It is incredibly important to know where it is that your visitors are coming from when they arrive at your
        landing page. This ultimately helps you get a bigger picture of how your campaign is performing.</p>
    <p>By determining the channels that bring in converting traffic, you can learn more about what optimizations to make
        to your page and where to focus your ad spend.</p>
    <p>For instance, if a large amount of your traffic is coming from Facebook and many of those leads convert, then you
        will want to consider investing more in the ads you’re using on that social media outlet.</p>
    <h3 id="cost-per-conversion">Cost Per Conversion</h3>
    <p>Cost per conversion lets you know how much you are spending on acquiring each new lead.</p>
    <p>While the goal is to increase the number of landing page conversions, you also don’t want to increase your costs
        significantly.</p>
    <h3 id="form-abandonment">Form Abandonment</h3>
    <p>Form abandonment refers to the number of visitors who began to fill out a form on your website and then left the
        site.</p>
    <p>There are numerous reasons why form abandonment may occur, including your form requesting sensitive details or
        too much information</p>
    <h3 id="return-vs-new-visitors">Return vs. New Visitors</h3>
    <p>This metric is pretty straightforward in what it is—showing you the percentage of return and new visitors to your
        landing page.</p>
    <p>If new visitors are spending more time on your landing page than returning visitors, you should consider offering
        them something to get them to come back again, such as a special coupon code.</p>
    <p>If your returning visitors have a higher bounce rate than new ones, then the quality/quantity of the content may
        not be as appealing.</p>
    <p>They are coming back for more, but the content is lacking. Therefore, you will want to examine your content
        strategy and see where you can make improvements to reduce the bounce rate of returning visitors.</p>
    <h2 id="video-performance-metrics">Video Performance Metrics</h2>
    <h3 id="watch-time">Watch Time</h3>
    <p>Watch time is the total amount of time a viewer spends watching your video. This metric is important because it
        shows how engaged your audience is with your video content.</p>
    <h3 id="traffic-sources">Traffic sources</h3>
    <p>This will tell you where your viewers came from. It's divided into several types: YouTube search, playlists,
        suggested videos, Google search, external website, and more.</p>
    <h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>
    <p>Impressions measure how many times your video thumbnail was shown to viewers. Impressions are only counted within
        YouTube—this metric doesn’t include any impressions on external sites or apps.</p>
    <h3 id="impressions-click-through-rate">Impressions Click-Through Rate</h3>
    <p>To round out our reach metrics, impressions click-through rate measures the percentage of clicks that were
        prompted to watch your video from their homepage, recommendations section, or trending section. This is a key
        metric to watch, because a high click-through rate is an indicator that your content is compelling for a wide
        audience on YouTube.</p>
    <h3 id="returning-viewers">Returning Viewers</h3>
    <p>Returning viewers measures how many people continue to come back to your YouTube channel and consume your video
        content. This will help you understand what segment of your audience is loyal to your brand. The hope is that
        this metric continues to rise as your viewers return time and time again to watch your videos.</p>
    <h3 id="unique-viewers">Unique Viewers</h3>
    <p>Unique viewers is an estimated number of people who watched your content over a certain time period. This metric
        helps you determine the actual size of your audience. This metric correlates to your subscribers.</p>
