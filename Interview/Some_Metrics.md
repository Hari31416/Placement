### Cross Selling

Cross-selling is encouraging the purchase of anything in conjunction with the primary product. For example, if a customer has already purchased a subscription to your marketing tool, cross-selling would encourage that customer to purchase a subscription to your CRM.

> Say you work at a fast-food franchise, and a patron orders a burger. If you wanted to cross-sell, you would offer extra items to make for a complete meal.

### Up Selling

Up-selling is encouraging the purchase of a more expensive product. For example, if a customer has already purchased a subscription to your marketing tool, up-selling would encourage that customer to purchase a subscription to your marketing tool with additional features.

> To upsell a burger, you’d offer options for a more elaborate burger. So, for example, adding a slice of cheese or a pickle for an additional fee. Or, you could tell them about a higher-quality cut of beef they could choose for a small premium.

## Metrics For Business Performance

### Total Revenue

Arguably the most important metric of any business is revenue. Total revenue can be measured on any time scale, typically monthly, quarterly, or annually.

### Average Revenue Per Account/Product/Customer

The average revenue brought in by a single product, service, account, or customer helps leaders and managers to understand where they should focus their attention and resources.

### Market Penetration

Understanding your market share is important because it measures where your business is compared to the expected growth outlined in your business or sales plan. Usually, you will find businesses measuring this against their total addressable market (TAM), which is an estimation of how big a given market is for a product or service.

### Percentage of Revenue from New vs. Existing Customers

Understanding what percentage of revenue is from new and existing customers is helpful for a few reasons. For example, if existing customers account for a growing percentage of total revenue, this can be an indicator your RevOps team is doing a great job of upselling and growing accounts, but the team tasked with acquiring new logos is lagging behind.

If new customers are the lion’s share of your revenue, then this could either be an indicator of a high churn rate or hypergrowth. To understand at what end of the spectrum your team is trending, it’s important to track LTV, NPS, and more.

### Win Rate

Win rate, or the opportunity-to-win ratio, is the measurement of successful deals or deals that close, in comparison to the total deals made – including those that are open, lost, slipped, or in another pipeline phase.

### Year-Over-Year Growth

Although growth can be measured over any timeframe – such as month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, or year-over-year – annual growth showcases high-level execution of strategy and whether long-term growth goals have been achieved.

### Lifetime Value (LTV) of a Customer

Lifetime value is the revenue that can be expected throughout the duration of the average relationship with a customer.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

What is the likelihood that your customers will recommend your product or service to their network?

This question is what sales professionals have in mind when they measure net promoter score, where they ask each customer the likelihood of them promoting their business through word of mouth from 1 (not very likely) to 10 (very likely).

### Sales Expense Ratio

It’s important to understand how your sales costs, direct customer acquisition costs, and indirect operating expenses compare to your revenue. The higher your sales expense ratio, the less profitable your sales organization will be.

## Website Performance Metrics

### Conversion Rate

Conversion rate is the percentage of visitors to your website who take a desired action. For example, if you have a landing page with a form to download a whitepaper, the conversion rate would be the percentage of visitors who fill out the form.

### Bounce Rate

The bounce rate can be defined as the percentage of web users who leave your website after only viewing a single page.

A high bounce rate is indicative of your landing page not being what visitors expected, usually in the form of content. Since they had no interest in the material they saw and taking action, they left the page without clicking on a link, completing a form, etc.

### Page Views

This is probably the most obvious metric that helps to determine the success of your landing page since it measures the number of people who are looking at your landing page.

Page Views metric allows you to see which pages are getting the most and least traffic.

### Average Time Spent on Page

Keeping an eye on how long visitors are staying on your landing page can be useful. However, keep in mind that the kind of landing page you have can have a direct impact on this metric.

Therefore, a shorter or longer average time spent on the page doesn’t have to indicate that your landing page is not performing well.

### Sessions by Source

It is incredibly important to know where it is that your visitors are coming from when they arrive at your landing page. This ultimately helps you get a bigger picture of how your campaign is performing.

By determining the channels that bring in converting traffic, you can learn more about what optimizations to make to your page and where to focus your ad spend.

For instance, if a large amount of your traffic is coming from Facebook and many of those leads convert, then you will want to consider investing more in the ads you’re using on that social media outlet.

### Cost Per Conversion

Cost per conversion lets you know how much you are spending on acquiring each new lead.

While the goal is to increase the number of landing page conversions, you also don’t want to increase your costs significantly.

### Form Abandonment

Form abandonment refers to the number of visitors who began to fill out a form on your website and then left the site.

There are numerous reasons why form abandonment may occur, including your form requesting sensitive details or too much information

### Return vs. New Visitors

This metric is pretty straightforward in what it is—showing you the percentage of return and new visitors to your landing page.

If new visitors are spending more time on your landing page than returning visitors, you should consider offering them something to get them to come back again, such as a special coupon code.

If your returning visitors have a higher bounce rate than new ones, then the quality/quantity of the content may not be as appealing.

They are coming back for more, but the content is lacking. Therefore, you will want to examine your content strategy and see where you can make improvements to reduce the bounce rate of returning visitors.

## Video Performance Metrics

### Watch Time

Watch time is the total amount of time a viewer spends watching your video. This metric is important because it shows how engaged your audience is with your video content.

### Traffic sources

This will tell you where your viewers came from. It's divided into several types: YouTube search, playlists, suggested videos, Google search, external website, and more.

### Impressions

Impressions measure how many times your video thumbnail was shown to viewers. Impressions are only counted within YouTube—this metric doesn’t include any impressions on external sites or apps.

### Impressions Click-Through Rate

To round out our reach metrics, impressions click-through rate measures the percentage of clicks that were prompted to watch your video from their homepage, recommendations section, or trending section. This is a key metric to watch, because a high click-through rate is an indicator that your content is compelling for a wide audience on YouTube.

### Returning Viewers

Returning viewers measures how many people continue to come back to your YouTube channel and consume your video content. This will help you understand what segment of your audience is loyal to your brand. The hope is that this metric continues to rise as your viewers return time and time again to watch your videos.

### Unique Viewers

Unique viewers is an estimated number of people who watched your content over a certain time period. This metric helps you determine the actual size of your audience. This metric correlates to your subscribers.
