# 1. Importance of HR Interview Questions
The goal of any HR interview is to assess a candidate's qualifications for the job they are interviewing for. HR interview questions help interviewers to determine whether or not a candidate is a good fit for the desired position. Every question is thoughtfully crafted to draw information that will either support or detract from a candidate's suitability. The most common questions in HR interviews are about a candidate's past experiences, education, and skills.

## 2.1. Tell me about yourself?
This question is usually the first question in an interview, and it is a way to break the ice. You should answer this question by giving a brief overview of your education, work experience, and skills. You should not go into too much detail, but you should provide the interviewer with enough information to determine if you are a good fit.

### 2.1.1. Some Tips
<ul>
<li>Do not ask the interviewer what he wants to know about you. You may be asking genuinely, but that just sounds rude.</li>

### 2.4.1. Sample Answers

This can prove to be a trap and you might not even be aware of it. While the question might seem casual, the main purpose of this question is to find out how long you are planning to stay in the company if hired and how your vision fits the vision of the company. You should promote your commitment to the company while looking toward growth opportunities.

You might be tempted to answer honestly by saying things about your plans for higher studies, your plans to start a startup, your plans of becoming a hiring manager in the company or if you don’t have a plan then you are simply tempted to say you don’t have a plan at all. These are the things the interviewer doesn’t want to hear and hence avoid giving such answers.

The recruiter is only interested in knowing how long you are planning to stay in the company and how satisfied you are with the current position you are going to be hired.

I have achieved several milestones to date in my career as a software developer. The most recent one is of the time when we were working on a critical component of a product pertaining to customer payments. We were working round the clock for around 2 months and I was a core developer. I was made a lead to this component for completing the task in another 2 months.

To meet the deadline, we ensured that we upskilled ourselves to learn all the aspects of the development of this module and also brought in a few more resources to complete it faster. Post the deployment, I trained our team to support the platform proficiently. Ultimately, we could complete the product well in advance of the deadline. When the product was launched, the higher management was super proud of us and our team was awarded for our outstanding performance in the quarterly town hall. It was a very proud moment for me.

#### 2.7.2.2. 2
I experienced my greatest achievement when I worked as a website manager for an entertainment outlet. My team was under pressure and the website was struggling at the time, and I was tasked with forming a strategy to increase traffic.

I’m proud of this accomplishment and I feel that what I learned is going to give me a big advantage in my career now.

My greatest professional achievement was turning around the success of my last employer’s Marketing department.

Within 6 months, we were achieving 20-25% above our goals, and my marketing plan brought in an additional $3 million in revenue for the company through the second half of last year. This additional revenue brought the company from an operating loss each quarter to profitability.
## 2.8. Tell me about a difficult situation you’ve faced and how you handled it. 
Similar phrases related to this question are:
- Describe a difficult situation or project and how you overcame it.
- Tell me how you handled a difficult situation.

As part of a behavioral-based interview, this is an effective way for a hiring manager to learn a great deal about an applicant without using multiple questions. It also helps in assessing your emotional intelligence, a deciding factor for many companies today.

Asking this question gives an interviewer insight on many key traits including:
- How you prioritize
- Your initiative
- Your communication skills
- Whether you own up to your mistakes
- Whether you can avoid creating drama
- The ways you deal with conflict, deadlines, and other work pressures
- The strength of your leadership skills
- Your instincts to ask for help when needed
- Your ability to think on your feet 
  
### 2.8.1. Tips
- Choosing to act with integrity during an ethical dilemma or challenge
- Taking initiative to approach and effectively solve difficult situations
- Using a particular thought or action process to find a solution to a tough problem
- Avoid speaking badly of current/former company, co-workers, supervisors, or direct reports.
- Try not to come across as “superior” in your past or current role.
- Conversely, don't play yourself down — unless it's explaining how you've grown.
- Don't describe a non-work-related situation, unless you have no relevant work experience to share.

### 2.8.2. Sample Answers
#### 2.8.2.1. 1
At my current job, a client called late Friday afternoon with an urgent question about their project status. Usually my boss directly interacts with our clients, but he'd already left for the weekend. I told the client that while I might not know the exact answer, I could possibly help because I was also working on the project. The client was fine with that. We worked through the question together, and I was able to provide enough information that the client felt the rest could wait until Monday. I left a detailed note for my boss asking him to check in with the client on Monday.

#### 2.8.2.2. 2
In my recent job as a department manager, there was a new hire who consistently provided incomplete reports. They were asked multiple times to include all the required information, but the reports continued to lack all the data and had to be redone for others to do their jobs. I wondered if the new employee was getting clear information, so I created a sample report for the new hire showing all the required data. I also asked other supervisors to review this with their reports and to post a chart of when the reports were due. As a result, the quality of everyone's reports improved, not just those of the new employee. I learned that it's really important to listen and to clearly communicate expectations to get the desired results.

## 2.10. How would you rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10?

## 2.11. What are your hobbies?

# 3. Behavioural HR Interview Questions
These questions are mostly of the format “Tell me about a time…” where you would be asked to share your experience based on certain scenarios which would help the interviewer judge how well you handled various work situations thereby reflecting your skills, capacity, and personality.

Always answer such types of questions using the STAR format to provide structured answers. STAR has the following questions to be answered in the same order:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Situation:</strong> What was the situation/event?</li>
<li>
<strong>Task:</strong> What were the tasks involved in the above-mentioned situation?</li>
<li>
<strong>Action:</strong> What did you do to complete the goal?</li>
<li>
<strong>Result:</strong> What was the result of the actions? This is the most important part which conveys if you were successful or not.</li>
</ul>

Here are some questions:

## 3.1. Tell me about a time when you were not satisfied with your performance?
Here, the interviewer gets to know the extent of ownership you take while performing any task. It also reflects how well you care about the job and the company.


## 3.2. Tell me about a time when you were made to work under close supervision.
Here, the interviewer evaluates how well you work in a team and how well you can work independently.

## 3.3. Can you tell me about a time where you were happy with your work and what was your reaction?
By asking this question, the interviewer wants to understand what success means to you and what feeling it brings out in you. By this, they can assess your concerns for the growth of the company along with your personal growth.
